# Using Transformer Neural Networks to Predict Inebriation Levels Based on Smartphone Accelerometer Data

This repository contains the data pre-processing, EDA, and the final Keras/TensorFlow 
Transformer Architecture used to make predictions based on accelerometer data. There is also a Bi-Directional LSTM notebook 
which was the previous approach taken before the novel Transformer architecture was found and adapted to our use-case. 

All notebooks were run on Google Colab Pro.
